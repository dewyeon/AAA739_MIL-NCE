past about", "my \"ian knot\", the world's fastest shoelace knot", "today i'm doing a tutorial video,", "much slower, much more detail", "i'm sure you'll be able to learn the \"ian knot\"", "from using this video", "now give me a second while we get set up here ", "and we can begin", "now i'll start by showing it to you at normal speed", "so you can see that it really is", "the world's fastest shoelace knot", "that's it - two steps, two seconds and it's tied!", "now let's look at that in more detail", "begin with a left-over-right starting knot,", "so that's the left end going over", "and through the right end", "then we create two loops", "the left-hand loop has the loose end in front", "and the right-hand loop has the loose end behind", "those loose ends get crossed over", "in the middle of the knot,", "fed through each other's loops,", "and pulled tight", "again,", "left-hand loop with the loose end in front,", "right-hand loop with the loose end behind", "now you'll notice i'm pushing", "the right-hand loose end", "in through this left-hand loop", "in front of that piece there,", "and at the same time i'm pushing", "this loose left end ", "through the right-hand loop,", "which goes behind that piece there", "and when i pull them through,", "it creates the knot", "now when people are first learning this knot,", "they tend to ... do the two loops ", "symmetrically, so here we've got mirror images,", "we've got both loose ends in front,", "or ... they'll do it like that,", "with both loose ends behind", "and that just simply won't work, you ", "push them through, and you just ", "you get nothing, there is no knot there", "so here's a trick for creating the loops", "in the right orientation:", "let's do it in two steps", "grab them each with the thumb and forefinger,", "thumbs towards you, forefingers away from you,", "and ... just swing them", "i'm swinging the left end to the front", "and the right end to the back, away from me", "next, i swing them upwards", "so that they meet in the middle", "and at this point,", "where everything's in the right position,", "we can just do the crossover and pull through", "again,", "grab them ... in each hand,", "swing the left end forwards, the right end backwards,", "swing them up to meet in the middle,", "and then do the crossover and feed through", "now as you start to get used to this,", "you'll have to do it less and less obviously", "as two steps, you'll be able to do", "sort of one flowing movement like that", "and eventually you'll just be able to do it ", "like that", "now the final thing to watch out for is that", "i tie my starting knot", "left-over-right,", "but a lot of other people tie their starting knot", "right-over-left", "now that's fine,", "and you'd think it wouldn't make much difference,", "but it does!", "when i do the remainder of the knot,", "notice how it's trying to sit", "\"along\" the shoe instead of \"across\" the shoe", "now that's an un-balanced knot", "that we call a \"granny knot\", and that knot", "will actually come undone a lot more easily", "so, either continue to do it the way that i do it", "with a left-over-right starting knot,", "and then swing the left end forwards,", "the right end backwards,", "meet in the middle, and pull it through", "or, do the whole lot in reverse", "you can do ... a right over left starting knot", "then the right end swings forwards,", "left end swings backwards,", "meet in the middle,", "pull through,", "and you've again got a balanced knot", "that'll stay securely tied", "finally, you may have noticed", "that i actually do my starting knot", "using the \"ian knot\" technique in reverse", "so i start by swinging the right end forwards,", "left end backwards,", "meet in the middle,", "pull the loose ends all the way through,", "to create my starting knot", "then i swing the left end forwards,", "the right end backwards,", "meet in the middle,", "and pull through to create the finishing knot", "so as long as those two steps", "are done in reverse of each other,", "you'll have a balanced knot that'll sit secure", "anyway, that's the \"ian knot\",", "hope you managed to learn it!",
